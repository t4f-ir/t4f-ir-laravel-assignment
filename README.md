# t4f.ir Laravel Assignment

## Overview
Welcome to the **t4f.ir Laravel Developer Assignment**.  
This challenge simulates a realistic backend scenario where youâ€™ll debug, refactor, and improve an existing Laravel 12 API project.

Estimated time: **3â€“4 hours**

Your objective is to identify and fix the issues listed below while following Laravel best practices.

## ðŸ§© Technical Assignment Description

This exercise is part of a small back-end project designed to manage event ticket sales.  
A very simple (and intentionally incomplete) Laravel project has already been created â€” however, it currently contains a few bugs and minor issues.

Your tasks are to:

1. Review the existing codebase and identify the bugs.
2. Fix the issues and improve the code quality where necessary.
3. Refactor names or structure if you find a clearer or more maintainable approach.
4. Document your changes briefly â€” for example, by writing notes or comments about what you fixed or improved.

> Some expectations are intentionally left unspecified â€” weâ€™ll evaluate your choices and decisions in the final result.  
> The main goal of this task is to understand **how you work with real code in practice**, not to achieve a perfectly flawless project.
